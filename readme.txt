Admin Cleaner allows you to hide admin menu items and restyle the login screen and admin menu colors

== Description ==

Generally speaking this plugin is intended for developers who make sites for clients though most intermediate 

Admin Cleaner allows you to hide / remove admin menu items such as Comments, Links, Dashboard, etc...from users that have no need to see these items.  You can also remove any of the default widgets that may just be taking up space.

This plugin also allows you to change the login logo, background color / image, admin menu background color, and admin menu text color.  This may be useful to brand the backend to your (or your client's) business.
